To-Do List
In rough order of priority (important first)

Fix up autoconf/automake macros for better cross-platform support
Add support for "subpackages" in updates files and internally
Revamp package recognition apparatus so that new package formats can be
  accomodated without having to recompile 
Support more versioning/compatibility schemes (ie, based on version, keywords,
  etc.)
