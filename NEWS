Overview of Changes from 0.1.8 to 0.1.9 (15 Jan 2005)
=====================================================
* Full support for luau-repository interface version 1.2 (see DTD)
* Several fixed double-free bugs and memory leaks
* New methods for the internally used GContainer object
* Converted some unimportant error messages to debugging messages
* Several minor bugs fixed

Overview of Changes from 0.1.7 to 0.1.8 (6 Jan 2005)
====================================================
* XML comments are now recognized and ignored.
* Unrecognizable tags in an XML file now lead to a debugging message rather
  than an error message.  They are still skipped.
* Support for systems without GNU extension function get_current_dir_name.
* Preliminary support for luau-repository DTD version 1.2 (not yet complete).

Overview of Changes from 0.1.6 to 0.1.7 (12 Jun 2004)
=====================================================
* The XML format has been updated to interface version 1.1 with the addition
  of the <program-info> tag, which is used to describe the program that the
  XML file is listing packages/messages for.
* Added --from-file and --from-url options to luau-register, which can be used
  to register a new program by feeding in the local location or URL
  (respectively) of its corresponding Luau XML repository file.
* Changed date format from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD to conform with ISO-8601
  standard.
* Revamped error output framework to work with GLib's error and message
  reporting services.
* Disabled gthread support by default due to unpredictable behavior.
* Updated autoconf scripts to be cleaner and work better.
* Several minor bugs were fixed.

Overview of Changes from 0.1.5 to 0.1.6 (14 Mar 2004)
=====================================================
* The XML format has changed significantly with this release.  The only
  significant change is in the XML parsing algorithms in order to accomodate
  these changes.
* Some bugs have also been fixed.

Overview of Changes from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5 (22 Feb 2004)
=====================================================
* The database code has been separated from the main libuau library into a
  new "libuau-db" library.  This means that binaries depending on libuau don't
  have to depend on libdb.  It also means the libuau library by itself can be
  installed without the database support (though this is not recommended).
* libuau now supports gthreads, meaning it should be usable in a threaded
  environment.  This is still under heavy testing, however.
* Software repository XML files can now be compressed using gzip to reduce
  bandwidth usage (on the server's side) and download time (on the client
  side).  zlib is required to uncompress gzipped files on the client side.
* A serious bug has been fixed in luau_db_setKeyword which previously could
  lead to a segmentation fault.  Many other minor bugs have also been fixed.
* Due to the separation of libuau and libuau-db, the public API has undergone
  several changes.  Any programs or libraries depending on libuau/libuau-db
  will have to be updated.
* Several updates have been made to the configure/Makefile.am scripts, which
  makes them more flexible and should make them more portable.

Overview of Changes from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4 (8 Jan 2004)
=====================================================
* The database code has been revamped to allow local users to override values
  set in the global databases.  This means that users can hide updates and
  even register their own programs with Luau without needing root access.
* Version comparison is now supported, meaning that one can use other types
  than just the release date (currently supported: version, keyword, and
  interface version) to test if an update is "valid."
* A testing suite has been added to ensure that changes between versions don't
  break features.  You can expect it to grow significantly over the next
  couple of versions.
* Several memory leaks and other memory allocation bugs that could cause
  segmentation faults have been fixed.
* There have been several internal changes that won't be visible to the
  end-user but should facilitate further development (such as the quantifier
  model and a new GContainer wrapper class).
* Autopackage file installation is now supported.
* Error checking has been enhanced to help catch both user input errors and
  internal problems.
* The "md5" and "size" attributes of the <package> tag are now optional and
  therefore may be omitted.
* Updates for versions older than or equal to the current version are
  automatically hidden, making obsolete the need to include something like
  '<valid type="version" to="1.2.3" />' (for version 1.2.3) to do so.

Overview of Changes from 0.1.2 to 0.1.3 (22 Dec 2003)
=====================================================
* The libuau API has undergone significant changes to avoid unnecessary dynamic
  allocation
* Multiple mirrors of provided packages is now supported by the XML software
  repository format
* luau_register has been changed to "luau-register" to match the format of the
  other command line tools
* Many options have been added to the program registration process in order to
  make the interface more friendly to users, including - a description field, a
  short-name field, a long-name field, and an interface version field (used by
  autopackage to determine appropriate software versions)
* Support has been added to work smoothly with the Autopackage project
  (www.autopackage.org) - Luau is being used as their means for providing
  automatic dependency retrieval
* Documentation has been greatly expanded to cover all the new functions and
  interfaces - debugging output has also been improved
* Many, many bugs have been fixed

Overview of Changes from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2 (21 Oct 2003)
=====================================================
* A new XML format for updates files has been adopted
* Fixed segmentation fault when retrieving program info
* Fixed some major bugs in interactive mode
* Added --email option to luau - this is very significant, since it allows the
  user to be automatically informed of updates using cron

Overview of Changes from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1 (11 Oct 2003)
=====================================================
* Interactive mode for 'luau' now works
* Program keywords are now supported
* luau_register now supports --keywords command-line opt
* Various minor bug fixes

Overview of Changes from 0.1.0pre2 to 0.1.0 (5 Oct 2003)
========================================================
* Package installation now works
* Fixed downloading bug (downloaded packages got truncated before)
* Fixed memory leak and memory overflow bug in luau_strjoin
* Program deletion now works
* Can now use VALIDTO and VALIDROM directives for any kind of update (not just
  software updates, like before)
* Fixed luau_register bug that didn't register null keywords correctly

Overview of Changes from 0.1.0pre1 to 0.1.0pre2 (3 Oct 2003)
============================================================
* Finished documenting libuau.h interface through doxygen comments
* Cleaned up and fixed Makefile.am and configure.in autoconfiguration and
  compilation files.
* Miscellaneous code clean-ups
* Added basic documentation files (README, NEWS, ChangeLog, etc.)
* Minor interface updates
